## How to use

<Step number={1} title='Login in your SendGrid Account' />

Login to your [SendGrid account](https://app.sendgrid.com/login), if you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://signup.sendgrid.com/)

<Step number={2} title='Add Sender Auth' />

We need to let SendGrid know which domains are authorized to send emails. To do this:

1. In your SendGrid dashboard, navigate to settings (on the left panel).
2. Click on Sender Authentication -> Authenticate Your Domain. Add your domain info.
3. Once you're finished, you should get 3 new DNS Records to add to your DNS provider.

<Step number={3} title='Generate your API Key' />

In your dashboard, go to settings -> API Keys. Click on `Create API Key`.

Give your key a meaningfull name so you can remember what it does. Then select API Key Permissions and create your key.

Remember to save your key in your `.env.local` file inside your Next Js project and don't push it to Github.

<Step number={4} title='Create API route' />

Inside your `api` folder add the code snippet in your project API route. You can name the route however you want.
