## Short Explanation

This project was build as part of the [Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). This was the first time I developed a React Project on my own.

**Note:** Recently I realized the project is not functioning as expected. After some digging I noted the API had some breaking changes so I have to update to code.

## Project Goals

The main goal of the project was to replicate the design, add dark mode and fetch data from the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and display the results on the website, all using React and Styled Components.

## Tech Stack

For this project I worked with the following stack:

- Frontend: React

- Styling: Styled Components

- API: Rest Countries API
