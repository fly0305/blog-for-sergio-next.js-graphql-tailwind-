## Short Explanation

I always like to test new technologies. And although so far, I had worked with React, I wanted to try Vue.js.

One of the most popular projects to practice is a To-do app. This type of application give you the opportunity of adding all the CRUD operations to your app. Because of this, I also saw the opportunity of adding some backend functionality to save users data, and for this, I also needed user authentication. Firebase offered me both, so, this was a really good opportunity to test firebase as well.

## Project Goals

The project main goals was to test the Vue.js framework and Firebase Auth and Firebase Firestore as a realtime database, on a basic To-Do Application.

## Tech Stack

For this project I used the following tech stack:

- Frontend: Vue

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- Backend Server: Firebase

## Dealing with Difficulties

The main difficulties of this project was to add the authentication, since this was my first time working with Firebase on my own.

Surprisingly, working with Vue was really fun and easier than I though.

## Lessons Learned

The main thing I learned besides Vue and Firebase Auth was creating my own custom hooks to fetch collections from Firebase.
