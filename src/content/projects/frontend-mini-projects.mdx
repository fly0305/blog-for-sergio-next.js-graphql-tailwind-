## Short Explanation

This is a collection of different side projects related to Frontend development that I've work on since I started learning web development.

Although the title may say "mini", here I have added different type of projects that uses mainly `HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript`.

Some of the projects where built as code alongs during my learning process. Others I have either done them myself (e.g. [frontend mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)) of taking the code along project and rebuild it on my own.
