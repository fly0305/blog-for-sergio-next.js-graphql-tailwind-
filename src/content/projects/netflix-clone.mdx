## Short Explanation

There are several made Netflix clones out there. All built using different tech stacks and methods (React, Node, Python, etc...). I think there is a reason for that. Netflix is one of the most popular and complex web applications out there. With it, you can put into practice several areas of web development (e.g. design, frontend and backend development, authentication, data persistence, API's...).

I always like to experiment and test new technologies, therefore, my idea for creating this projects (as with many of my own personal projects) is testing some of the technologies I've learned, combined with other new ones and putting it all together in trying to build one of the most popular websites out there.

## Project Goals

My main goal was to put in practice everything I've learned so far as a web developer and applying it to a complex application like Netflix, and trying to replicate as much as I able to do give the obvious limitations of creating a platform like this one.

## Tech Stack

Of course, the original website is way more complex, so I'm trying to replicate at least the most basic elements that are part of the website, this are:

- UI/UX (frontend).

- Styling

- Display Movies and Series.

- User Authentication.

- User data persistence into a database.

### UI/UX (Frontend) - Next.js

As I mentioned before, there are many Netflix clones out there and all of them created using different tech stacks. In my case, I decided to go with my current favorite frontend technology, Next.js.

Next.js give me some many alternatives (SSR, SSG, CSG, API Routes, etc.) that for me is a no brainer for many applications.

### Styling - Tailwind CSS

This is other of my go to technologies in most of my projects, easy to setup, fast development and you can do around 90% of what you do with plain CSS or CSS-in-JSX and the rest, well, just write it in CSS.

### Display Movies and Series - The MovieDB API

This is perhaps the more important decision when making something similar to Netflix. Of course, it's not easy to have access to a database such as the one Netflix has. So, after some research, I came up to 2 solutions: Youtube API and The MovieDB API.

Either options would be find to this project but, in the end, I felt that TMDB API gave me more than enough data for the project, so I went with it.

### User Auth and Database - Firebase

This is the other part of the puzzle, users and database. I needed to achieve to main goals, user Auth and data persistence. For this project I didn't feel the need to create a full backend server like using Node.js and Express for this tasks, so I wanted to find something easier.

My first choice was Firebase. Google's platform had all I needed for the project, it allowed me to authenticate users and store users data all at the same time. In general Firebase is a somewhat easy platform to use, plus it saves you the time of creating and deploying a backend server.

Another alternative was a combination of Magic Links (for password-less auth) with Hasura Database. I was intrigued to use Hasura for the first time and test their GraphQL API. But the one thing this combo had against was that I needed to use to different services, vs Firebase alone.

Here is where I decided to use Firebase. And then, I stumbled with Supabase. In Supabase own words, they are the "Open Source Firebase Alternative". At the end I decided to use Firebase for this project. But I looking to work with Supabase in another project soon.

## Dealing with difficulties

Replicating Netflix UI to the pixel will be really difficult, there is no doubt about it. But I think the biggest difficulty for a project like this would be getting videos data, like series or movies. The best option I found to obtain this data was [The MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
