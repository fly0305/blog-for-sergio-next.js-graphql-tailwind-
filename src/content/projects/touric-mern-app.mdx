## Short Explanation

Even tough I have mostly focus on training as a frontend developer, I also like mixing things up so I wanted to learn some technologies for backend development. I started learning Node.js and built some small API's and projects. But, I wanted to push it a bit more so I wanted to create a Full-stack application.

I started learning backend development with [Jonas Schmedtmann Bootacamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/). So, my idea was to take the course main project API and rebuild it on my own, and instead of using a templating engine for rendering the frontend I used React.

## Project Goals

Build a project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Tech Stack

For this project I used the MERN stack.

- Frontend: React

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- Server: Node / Express

- Database: MongoDB
