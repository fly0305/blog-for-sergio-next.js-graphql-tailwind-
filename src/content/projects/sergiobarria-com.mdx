## Short Explanation

What is a Web Developer without his/her own portfolio website?

This project has come a long way and several changes on design, dev technologies, databases and many other this.

I've come to the realization that I use my personal website not just to showcase some of my projects, or to display my personal blog, but as basically a testing repository in which I try some of the new things I've learned over time.

## Project Goals

This project main and original goal is to display some of the projects I've work on over time, what I've learned and to share some of my thoughts throughout my personal blog.

### Personal Portfolio V1

So, this version is basically the first time I've tried to build a website on my own. Before this, almost everything I built was as a code along on some of the web development courses I've taken.

#### Tech Stack

This projects was first build using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). At this point I didn't knew much about back-end development and because I wanted to have a blog, the best alternative I found was using a Headless CMS (JamStack style). After some research I ended using [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/). I remember having some trouble using a Headless CMS for the first time but at the end everything worked fine.

  />
</div>

### Personal Portfolio V2

After a few weeks of having my personal portfolio (or maybe days ðŸ¤”), I decided to do some major changes to my website, so V2 was born. I decided to change my CMS and try out Sanity.io.

#### Tech Stack

- JavaScript Framework: **Next.js**

- Styling: **Tailwind CSS**

- Content Management: **Sanity.io**

    alt='portfolio website version 2'
    width='50%'
  />
</div>

### Personal Portfolio V3

Again, I got this thing about changing my website, but this time I decided to change my JavaScript framework and test Gatsby.

#### Tech Stack

- JavaScript Framework: **Gatsby**

- Styling: **Tailwind CSS**

- Content Management: **Sanity.io**

**Links**:

    alt='personal website version 3'
  />
</div>

### Personal Portfolio V4(ðŸ¤”?)

Ok, I have to be honest. There might have been another version between version 3 and 4. But I decided take it down because I felt that website served other professional purpose so I wanted to build it but outside of my personal portfolio and as a side future project.

The website looked something like this:

<div>
  <img
    src='https://res.cloudinary.com/sbarria-dev/image/upload/v1642054067/sergiobarria/projects/my-portfolio_u5yi9x.png'
    alt='personal website alternate version'
  />
</div>

Anyway, where was I?, oh right!. Version 4.

So, basically V4 is the website your reading right now. I always wanted a minimalistic design for my personal website and focus it more on the content. If you have been around the Next.js ecosystem for some time, you probably know [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/), he works at Vercel and knows a lot about Next.js, so, you won't be surprised to hear that I took 'some' inspiration from his website and adapted to my style.

Of course, this website will always be a work in progress, but, I like the state it is right now. Although simple, this website doesn't use any Headless CMS for content management. All my content is manage using MDX and rendering using a relatively new technology called [Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer).

It also connects to some API's like Spotify, Github GraphQL and Notion's API, to pull data via Next.js tools like ISR, or the useSWR hook.

I recently added testing with Cypress and Jest as I started learning testing in general. Currently the project has very basic test, but I plan on adding more. Also added some CI/CD via Github actions.

## Dealing with difficulties

It's safe to say that this project has put me through a lot of difficulties, specially considering that every time I change it, always tried to use something new and different. Nevertheless it also has helped me to learn a lot from past mistakes and other developers code.

## Lessons Learned

There are countless lessons I can take from working on my personal website, so I will enumerate just the ones I consider the most important.

1. **Make it your own**: during working on this project I had the chance of seen many awesome portfolio websites. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you take inspiration from someone else, what matters is that you make it yours and at your own style to it.

2. **Don't overthink it:** I have spent hours listing stuff that I want to add to this project and when I saw the list ended doing non of them. Just start small and keep working, one task at the time util you feel pleased enough with the result.

3. **Enjoy the process**: creating your own website can be overwhelming, specially if it is the first time you do it. I think you should just enjoy the process and have fun!
