title: 'About Me'
---

Hi, I'm Sergio. I'm a civil engineer who recently has decided to try on a different professional path, this time as a web developer.

## A little about me

Ever since I can remember all I wanted was to become an Engineer: a **Civil Engineer**. So, I went to college, graduated - no, it wasn't easy!- and happily started to work in my dream career. For the past few years, I've been working on several different jobs learning more and more about construction. I have no complaints and no regrets.

I first started programming back in college - yes, civil engineers also learn programming-. Back then I knew nothing about programming, not even the most basic terms, but for some weird reason I really liked it, even though from the point of view of a software developer what we did back then wasn't really programming.

Because of my career, I left behind programming as what could be described as a really cool college experience and from here and there will add in my resume that I knew how to write code.

## Resuming programming

A little time ago, I had some free time at home, so I decided to explore some possible new interests and even though I found some, I met again with programming. Over the past few months I've been studying, learning and practicing programming on my own and have regained that curiosity that drive you into something that you can be passionate about.

## What is this blog about?

By creating this blog, I want to used it as a platform to share my experience as a self taught developer, especially with those who like me when started, are struggling in their journey and think that it is too difficult or even impossible to learn how to code. I want them to know, they are not alone and that we all struggle, but if you really want it, then it's not impossible.

I also want to share my personal point of view on changing careers, the struggles, fears and doubts. But also share those moments of personal and professional realization as both and engineer and developer.

## What content to expect

In this website you will see my progress as a developer. I'm going to be sharing my latest projects and thoughts regarding web and mobile development. Also tips, tricks and advices related to many programming languages and tools available.

I'll be sharing with you valuable online resources that are available to everybody and can help you improve your coding skills (both soft and hard skills) or give you new ideas for your personal designs, development projects and much more.

Although this website is destined mainly for programming in general. I will be sharing some other topics that in some how may help to improve not just your programming journey but maybe even help your in your regular day to day.

So, without further to do. **_Let start coding together!_**
