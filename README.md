My personal portfolio and blog hosted at [sergiobarria.com](https://www.sergiobarria.com/).

I recently migrated my porfolio from a Gatsby - Sanity.io stack to using Next js.

## Overview

I created the first two versions of my portfolio using Next.js and a combinations of a couple of headless CMS's for content management, and although I didn't had any problem I decided to try and use Gatsby. I had no problem either and for the most part really enjoyed using Gatsby, however I ended deciding to switch back to Next.js.

I really like using headless CMS's like [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). But in this ocasion I decided to manage my content by myself using markdown. After a little research I decided to try with MDX and ended with the result you see [here](https://www.sergiobarria.com/).

## Technologies used

- JS Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- UI Framework: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Content Management: [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
